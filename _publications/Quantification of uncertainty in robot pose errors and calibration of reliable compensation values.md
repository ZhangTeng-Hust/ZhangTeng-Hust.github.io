excerpt: 'In this work, the uncertainty in robot pose errors is focused on, to bridge the limitations of past uncertainty quantification methods such as assumption dependence and midpoint substitution, a joint prediction method for robot pose errors is proposed to achieve accurate estimation of point and intervals at the same time. In addition, to address the problem that most of the existing researches are based on the point prediction results for direct error compensation, which is heavily dependent on the point prediction accuracy, a reliable compensation value calibration strategy is proposed. The proposed strategy realizes further improvement of point prediction accuracy based on joint prediction. The proposed method is verified on three spatial trajectories of the ISO 9283-1998 standard, showing accurate joint prediction capability and reliable accuracy improvement. Through online compensation experiments, the pose errors are reduced by 90%, which promotes the application of robots in higher-precision scenarios.'

### Contribution

In this paper, quantification of uncertainty in robot pose errors and calibration of reliable compensation values are proposed, which focus on the characteristics of robotic systems with multiple error sources and strong uncertainty, to bridge the current prediction and compensation paradigm that relies on point estimation. This method enables the quantification of the possible intervals of the prediction results and the improvement of the accuracy of the compensation value based on it. Overall, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. A joint point-interval prediction method is proposed in this paper. With the help of an asynchronous start-up strategy, the quantification of the uncertainty interval of the robot's pose errors is achieved with the help of two components, the nuclear predictor and the auxiliary predictor, without affecting the accuracy of the point prediction. This provides data support for subsequent error compensation. 
2. Based on the joint point-interval prediction results, a reliable compensation value calibration method is proposed. The proposed method not only realizes the accuracy improvement of point prediction, but also the priority interpretation of the calibration for the compensation values is achieved with the help of fuzzy logic.
3. The proposed method is validated in five tasks including space motions, constant load and milling processing. By the proposed method, the accuracy of pose errors prediction is significantly improved, which provides a strong support for the subsequent compensation. In addition, after the validation through online compensation, the maximum reduction of the pose errors reaches 90% and the minimum is more than 70%.
