## Description

I am conducting my high school studies in Huairen No. 1 Middle School in Shuozhou City, Shanxi Province. My class was class 505 (science general class).

I scored 613 points in the college entrance examination, with which I was successfully admitted to the School of Mechanics of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA).
