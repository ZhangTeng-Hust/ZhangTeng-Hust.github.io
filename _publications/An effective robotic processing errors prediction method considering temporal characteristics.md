excerpt: 'This paper presents a combined statistical principles and machine learning model that achieves high robot milling errors prediction accuracy, called PSO-ARIMA. It is an Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model with milling force correction that has been optimized by the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Compared to the other five existing algorithms, the proposed method has the highest prediction accuracy. The maximum MAE for pose errors prediction in the four validation tasks is only 0.021 mm and 0.011°, which meets the actual application requirements. It can efficiently and accurately accomplish online prediction of errors to improve the accuracy of robotic milling.'

### Contribution

In this paper, a PSO-ARIMA robot milling errors prediction method is proposed. The method can effectively predict robot milling errors with high accuracy, enabling online prediction and perceive in advance. The main conclusions are as follows:

1.  This paper proposes the PSO-ARIMA method that integrates statistical principles and machine learning to accurately predict positional errors while maintaining interpretability. In four validation tasks, the maximum MAE of the prediction results for position error and posture error are 0.021mm and 0.011°, which fulfills the requirements of practical applications. 
2. The preprocessing module for data alignment was designed to minimize alignment errors present in the raw data. This effectively reduces the alignment errors associated with widespread communication time fluctuations, resulting in improved accuracy of the error calculation.
3. The prediction is enhanced by using conditional milling force data, meanwhile the PSO algorithm enables reliable and high-quality setting of the model's unknown parameters. In the future, more in-depth research will be conducted on the robot milling errors prediction, and consider the integration of statistical prediction methods and machine learning prediction algorithms to further simplify the prediction model and improve the prediction accuracy and stability.
