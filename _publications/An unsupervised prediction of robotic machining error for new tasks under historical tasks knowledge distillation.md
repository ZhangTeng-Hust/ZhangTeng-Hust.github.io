excerpt: 'Industrial robots have become an important machining equipment after machine tools in recent years, due to the advantages of, large workspace, and flexible work modes. However, the weak rigidity brought by the serial configuration leads the robot to shuffle from large errors. In addition, under the coupling of external time-varying dynamic loads and position-dependent characteristics, the robot machining error shows significant condition sensitivity. Data-driven becomes an effective mean. However, the performance of data-driven models is severely affected by the differences in working conditionsï¼Œsuch as machining parameters, workpiece shape, etc. To this end, a new tasks unsupervised prediction method for robotic machining error prediction with historical knowledge distillation is proposed, in which the knowledge of historical tasks is distilled by a lightweight model, which achieves the transfer and reuse of domain knowledge, and improves the generalization ability of data-driven models for similar tasks. Based on eight historical tasks, robotic machining error prediction was performed for two new tasks, one with different parameters and the other with different shape. The effectiveness of the proposed method is fully verified by analyzing and comparing. Further, the scalable and maintainable digital twin system is initially constructed in order to better fulfill the needs of robotic manufacturing. The proposed method can provide a strong impetus to the development of knowledge-based intelligent manufacturing for robots.'

### Contribution

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for predicting robotic machining errors in new working conditions, based on historical task knowledge distillation. First, a robust historical model is trained using abundant historical data. Then, a lightweight student model is developed to distill and transfer knowledge from the historical model, focusing on three key aspects: accuracy, model structure, and data. The proposed method was tested on two new tasks with significant parameter and shape differences. The results demonstrated the substantial advantages of the knowledge distillation approach for unsupervised prediction in novel tasks.
