## Description

I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Engineering at HUST's School of Mechanical Science and Engineering College, where I specialize in Mechanical Engineering. As of this writing, I have a weighted GPA of 92.7 out of 100, which places me first in my class of all Ph.D.s (1/144),  [**Transcript**](..\files\Transcript.pdf) 



## Supervisor and my research interests

I was instructed by three supervisors at the same time, and their basic profiles are as follows, 

| Name               |                                                              | Homepage                                                     | Mailbox             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Prof. Fangyu Peng  | Recipient of the National Outstanding Youth Fund and the New Century Excellent Talents of the Ministry of Education | [Peng's Homepage](https://mse.hust.edu.cn/info/1145/1438.htm) | pengfy@hust.edu.cn  |
| Prof. Xiaowei Tang | Recipient of the National Outstanding Youth Science Foundation | [Tang's Homepage](https://mse.hust.edu.cn/info/1145/1436.htm) | tangxw@hust.edu.cn  |
| Prof. Rong Yan     | Responsible for the National Natural Science Foundation of China's top-level projects, joint machine projects, etc. | [Yan's Homepage](https://mse.hust.edu.cn/info/1145/1439.htm) | yanrong@hust.edu.cn |

My research interests can be divided into three phases:

| Stage                      | Research interests                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Stage 1（2020.09~2021.12） | Multi-axis CNC machining, machining error prediction for thin-walled parts, data-driven |
| Stage 2（2022.01~2022.12） | Point cloud vision measurement                               |
| Stage 3（2023.01~Now）     | Integrated study of error measurement, sensing, prediction, and compensation in robotic machining systems |

In the future, I have a wealth of interest in the following areas:

- Meta-knowledge extraction, distillation, characterization and application in a typical big data scenario of smart manufacturing;
- Generalized robot generalization data characterization and propriety cognition and performance evaluation based on it;
- Practical digital intelligences (digital twins, Industry 5.0 architecture) for pre-simulation, process monitoring and decision control in engineering and manufacturing.
