excerpt: 'In this article, a spatial-temporal feature fusion model for intelligent foreknowledge of robot machining error is proposed. Different from the existing research on robot error or machining error, the proposed method pays attention to both the spatially-dependent ontological error characteristics of the robot and the time series characteristics of the robot machining process, and it is designed with the spatial-temporal feature extraction and the attention mechanism link for the above two characteristics, which realizes the feature extraction for different spatial arrangements and different workpiece shapes. Finally, after feature fusion and mapping, accurate prediction of robot machining errors is achieved.'

### Contribution

On the one hand, this paper can adequately qualitatively analyze the spatial–temporal coupling characteristics of robotic machining errors, and on the other hand, the proposed method can provide a theoretical and modeling basis for the subsequent development of online compensation of robotic machining errors. The contribution of this paper can be summarized as,

1. Firstly, from the three aspects of processing error causes, data analysis and feature extraction, it reveals that the robot processing process is a complex coupled system with spatial–temporal relationship. The robot ontology error and robot processing error are coupled and coexist. Based on this cognition and analysis, a spatial-temporal feature fusion method for intelligent prediction of robot processing error is proposed in this work.
2. Secondly, the proposed method achieves accurate feature extraction and reliable prediction of robot processing error with the help of designed spatial and temporal feature extraction module, spatial–temporal attention mechanism module, and 18 feature level fusion mapping module altogether. The contribution of each module in ensuring the prediction accuracy method is verified through feature analysis and ablation experiments, etc.
3. Finally, the proposed method was experimentally validated on the inner wall features of a profiled compartment segment. Five parts designed were utilized for training and three parts for testing. A minimum RMSE of 0.026 mm is finally achieved, which is significantly better than other common methods.
