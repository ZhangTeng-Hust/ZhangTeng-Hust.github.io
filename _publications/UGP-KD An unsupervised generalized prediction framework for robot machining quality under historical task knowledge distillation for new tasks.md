excerpt: 'The influence mechanisms of robot errors by different working conditions and spatial ontology properties are explored in this paper. A spatial-temporal dual-view error prediction model is constructed for a single condition. Moreover, an innovative unsupervised generalized prediction strategy of machining error for new conditions under the historical task knowledge distillation of Multi-Teacher-Single-Student (MTSS) is proposed. This strategy enables the extraction and reuse of knowledge at three levels: teacher-teaching, student-learning, and generalized expansion. It also ensures the high-precision, lightweight, and high-efficiency prediction of machining error for unseen conditions. '

### Contribution

The contribution points of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1. Firstly, A fusion mapping machining error prediction model was proposed for a single condition from the dual perspectives of temporal and spatial fusion. An accurate prediction of the machining error under the influence of the spatial dependence and temporal fluctuation coupling factors of a robotic machining system was realized.
2. Secondly, Multi-Teacher-Single-Student (MTSS) unsupervised generalized prediction framework for multiple working conditions is proposed. The reuse of the mapping knowledge of different working conditions and generalization to new working conditions was achieved by knowledge distillation for trained single-condition dual-view machining error prediction models under different working conditions.
