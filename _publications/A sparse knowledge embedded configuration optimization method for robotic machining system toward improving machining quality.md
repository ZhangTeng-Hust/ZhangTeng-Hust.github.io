excerpt: 'In recent years, robotic machining has become one of the most important paradigms for the machining of large and complex parts due to the advantages of large workspaces and flexible configurations. However, different configurations will correspond to very different system performances, influenced by the position-dependent properties. Therefore, the configuration optimization of robotic machining system is the key to ensure the quality of robotic operation. In response to the fact that little attention has been paid in current research to the effect of mapping model distribution differences on the optimization results, a sparse knowledge embedded configuration optimization method for robotic machining systems toward improving machining quality is proposed. The knowledge of theoretical model-based optimization in terms of stage, density and redundancy is embedded into high-fidelity data by three steps sparse and real measurement. Pre-training and domain adaptation fine-tuning strategies are used to reconstruct the real mapping model accurately. The reconstructed mapping model is re-optimized to obtain a more accurate system configuration. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by machining experiments on space segment parts. The proposed method reduces the absolute position error and machining error by 48.67 % and 28.73 %, respectively, compared to the current common theoretical model-based optimization. This is significant for more accurate and reliable robot system optimization. Furthermore, this work confirms the influence of mapping model distribution differences on the optimization effect, providing a new and effective perspective for subsequent research on the optimization of robotic machining system configurations.'

### Contribution 

In this paper, from the perspective of knowledge embedding and transfer, an accurate mapping model is reconstructed through highfidelity sparse sample labeling to achieve more accurate and reliable optimization results. The contributions of this work can be summarized in the following three points:

1. At the data level, stage knowledge, population density knowledge, and redundant sample knowledge optimized based on the theoretical mapping model are embedded into high-fidelity sparse data through three steps sparse and real measurements.

2. At the model level, pre-training and domain adaptation fine-tuning strategies transfer the mapping knowledge from the model in the form of structures and parameters to the real model, and achieve accurate reconstruction of the real mapping model with high-fidelity data.

3. The proposed method is experimentally validated for robotic milling machining on workpieces extracted from local features of space segment parts. It achieves smaller absolute position error and machining error compared to the optimization based on theoretical mapping model, which fully confirms the innovative research perspective of this study.

   

In the future, the actual working condition data and the uncertainty in the machining process will be integrated to realize the accurate and efficient reconstruction of the real mapping model. In addition, we will extend the method studied in this paper to different working conditions. The optimization enhancement from the theoretical model to the actual model for a single working condition to the optimization enhancement for different working conditions will be realized. Finally, inspired by multi-task evolutionary transfer learning, we plan to address the differences in optimization results due to distributional differences from a thorough transfer learning perspective.
