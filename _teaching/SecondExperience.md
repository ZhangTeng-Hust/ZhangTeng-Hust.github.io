##### Description

I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from NUAA's College of Mechanical & Electrical Engineering, where I majored in Mechanical Engineering. My class was 105, and I always held the position of class president, and my homeroom teacher was [Prof. Yinfei Yang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yang-Yinfei). At the time of graduation, I had an average GAP of 4.1 (full GPA = 5.0), which was the second highest in the college out of 313 students in my class. With this achievement, I was recommended by the Ministry of Education to pursue my doctoral degree at HuaZhong University of Science and Technology （HUST）.

During these four years, I received many honors at different levels including college level, school level, Ministry of Education and national level.

During this time, I was almost directly or indirectly involved in several projects in the fields of mechanical design, mechanical engineering, and mechatronics. However, it is important to recognize that some of these projects were very complete, but there were also some that seem to be rather basic nowadays. These experiences have provided me with a wealth of hands-on skills and careful thinking.
